The error you're encountering (`WinError 225: Operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted software`) is likely due to Windows Defender or your antivirus software falsely flagging PyInstallerâ€™s output files as a potential threat.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

### 1. **Whitelist or Exclude the Directory**
Windows Defender or other antivirus software may be blocking some operations that PyInstaller needs to perform. You can temporarily disable real-time protection or whitelist your project directory in your antivirus software.

#### Steps to Exclude in Windows Defender:
1. Open **Windows Security**.
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**.
3. Click **Manage settings** under **Virus & threat protection settings**.
4. Scroll to **Exclusions** and click **Add or remove exclusions**.
5. Select **Add an exclusion**, choose **Folder**, and select the folder where your project files reside (e.g., `E:\05-09-2024\test`).

### 2. **Run PyInstaller as Administrator**
Some operations that PyInstaller performs (such as creating the final executable) require higher privileges.

1. Open **Command Prompt** as an Administrator:
   - Search for "cmd" in the Start menu.
   - Right-click **Command Prompt** and choose **Run as administrator**.
2. Try running the PyInstaller command again:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "backup-export;backup-export" --add-data "export;export" --add-data "import;import" --add-data "temp;temp" --noconsole main.py
   ```

### 3. **Check PyInstaller Configuration**
Sometimes specific files, such as icons or resource files, can trigger this error. If you're using a custom icon, try running PyInstaller without an icon to rule out any issues with icon embedding:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py
```

### 4. **Disable Antivirus Temporarily (if safe)**
If none of the above solutions work, you may need to temporarily disable your antivirus software during the build process. Make sure to re-enable it after running the PyInstaller command.

Let me know if any of these solutions work or if the issue persists!

before running this command make sure your code is correct and given path 
pyinstaller main.spec
